**March 20, 2025**: I have managed to acquire the hexandcube.com domain name. As a result, I will be migrating my website
from the current hexandcube.eu.org domain, to the new hexandcube.com domain. The old domain will remain active for the 
foreseeable future, and will eventually redirect to the new domain.
