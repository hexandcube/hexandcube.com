[https://github.com/hexandcube/performancecraft/issues](https://github.com/hexandcube/performancecraft/issues)

Alternative to Optifine. Increased performance and smoother gameplay, with additional tweaks and fixes, designed to work
on all Vanilla multiplayer servers.

This modpack is essentially a stripped down version of [Hexandcube's Client Tweaks](/files/hexandcubes-client-tweaks), with all features that could
potentially affect gameplay removed, made for playing on public multiplayer servers.

### Features:

- Improved rendering performance
- Improved network stack
- Improved lighting engine
- Improved block and entity culling
- Faster GUI rendering
- Faster animations
- Client and Server side bug fixes
- Better RAM management
- Faster loading time
- Borderless Fullscreen
- Faster block entities
- Fast language switching
- Faster XP orbs
- Better performance when game is minimized
- Optifine shaders support
- Zoom key (change keybinds)
- Optifine and MinecraftCapes custom cape support

#### Capes
By default this modpack will prioritise official Minecraft capes. If you want to use free MinecraftCapes.net capes, open the Mods menu, search for 'Capes', click the options icon, and change Cape Type to Minecraft Capes.
