description: Hi! I'm @hexandcube! Here's what you should know before interacting with me on Twitter.
--- 

# Follow me for

- Photos of cats 
- Photos of foxes
- Photos, in general
- Screenshots of broken software
- Opinions
- Tweets mostly in English, but sometimes in Polish
- And other random stuff that I find interesting

&nbsp;

If you don't like what I post, you can always unfollow me. You don't have to tell me that you unfollowed me, I don't care.

# Direct Messages

My DMs are open, if you want to talk to me, feel free to send me a message. But please, [don't just say hello](https://nohello.net/).
Any spam messages will result in an instant block. 

# Followed accounts

Following someone is not an endorsement. Just because I follow you doesn't mean I agree with everything you say.
Please don't message me asking me to unfollow someone. I know who I follow, and I follow them for a specific reasons.

# Blocking

Due to the nature of Twitter I have to block some accounts, to not go insane.
This list, contains the types of accounts, I will most likely block.
If your account meets any criteria listed here, you probably shouldn't interact with me on Twitter.

On very rare occasions I will megablock a Tweet, which will automatically block its author and everyone who liked the
Tweet. This is a nuclear option which is only used on the worst Tweets on the platform.

If you think I've blocked you by accident, please [let me know](/about).

**I'm blocking accounts that:**

- Have been created within the last 4 weeks, have no profile picture and have the default Twitter username (with numbers)
- Engage in activities harmful to other people
- Discriminate other users based on nationality, religious beliefs, identity, gender, etc.
- Spread misinformation - Information confirmed to be false
- Spread theories (theses) as facts without providing scientific proofs
- Are a part of known dangerous organizations and hate groups
- Support actions of terrorist regimes (e.g. Russia, North Korea)
- Promote or endorse, products or services for profit without clearly declaring the advertisement
- Impersonate another individual or organization (Parodies are ok)
- Post Tweets with hashtags that are not related to the content of the Tweet
- Are operated by cryptobros[^1]
- Religiously support Elon Musk (You know what I mean)
- Promote scams

Since December 12th (If Twitter survives):
- Pay for Twitter Blue Verification

# Muting

If an account doesn't meet my criteria for blocking but is just annoying, it will get muted. 
This includes everyone who advertises on Twitter. 

&nbsp;

If you have any questions, feel free to [ask](/about).


[^1]: The term cryptobro refers to overly enthusiastic, dogmatic cryptocurrency supporters that try to forcefully
convince people that cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and Web3 are the future.
