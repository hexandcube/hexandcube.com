I have decided to leave my current Twitter account behind and migrate to a clean one. There are multiple reasons for
this decision, some personal, many related to the current state of the platform.

Starting today (May 31, 2024 CEST), I will no longer post on my legacy account (now under the
[@hexandcube_old](https://twitter.com/hexandcube_old) handle).

All activity has been moved to the now active new account, which uses the same handle as before,
[@hexandcube](https://twitter.com/hexandcube).

If you want to continue following me on Twitter, you will need to follow the new account, as the follower list
cannot be migrated.

The legacy account will remain open for the time being, but will be locked down in the future.
Everyone who, as of today follows the old account, will retain access to it for the foreseeable future for archival
purposes.

I will update this notice with any further information as needed.
